# Grafana_Loki_Promtail


It's all about monitoring the logs of the system on dashboard using grafana ; prom tail is for taking the logs from system and also for collecting mmany logs by configuring the promtail.config editor file using targets and jobs are fixed and also loki for giving the data to grafana as an agent which will only send the logs of system not metrics for metrics we have to define prometheus for time stamp metrics for the servers we have not used kubernetes that's why we are not using prometheus.
